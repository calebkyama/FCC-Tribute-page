			<h2 class="font">Here's a time-line of Avicii's life:</h2>
			<ul class="font" style="text-align: justify;">
				<br>
				<li><b>1989–2010: Early life and career</b> - Tim Bergling was born in Stockholm on 8 September 1989, the son of Klas Bergling and actress Anki Lidén.[13] He had three siblings: David Bergling, Linda Sterner, and actor Anton Körberg. He started mixing in his bedroom at the age of eight.

Inspired by his brother, who was also a DJ, he began making music at the age of 16.In May 2007, Bergling signed on with the Dejfitts Plays label.[13] He was a member of the Laidback Luke Forums, where he refined his craft and, at times, demonstrated his distinct deep house style.By 2009 to 2010, Bergling was a prolific producer and was releasing music incredibly quickly. His remixes during this period were "Sound of Now", "Muja", "Ryu" and "Even". Bergling explained that the name Avicii means "the lowest level of Buddhist hell" and he chose the moniker because his real name was already used upon creating his Myspace page.Then, in 2010, Bergling released the hit song "Seek Bromance", which reached the top 20 in several countries, including Belgium,France,the Netherlands,United Kingdom,and Sweden.He also remixed Nadia Ali's classic single "Rapture" for her album Queen of Clubs Trilogy: Onyx Edition. In October 2010, Bergling signed with the European A&R team with EMI Music Publishing.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>2011–2013: "Levels"</b> - n 2011, Bergling's track "Fade into Darkness" was sampled by Leona Lewis on her single "Collide". The sampling was not accredited and led to controversy as Bergling attempted to block the single's release. The matter was resolved out of court, with "Collide" being made a joint release between Lewis and Bergling.[25] In October 2011, Bergling released "Levels", which launched him into the mainstream. "Levels" reached the top ten in Austria,[26] Belgium,[27] Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Denmark,[28] Finland,[29] Germany,[30] Greece, Ireland,[31] Italy,[32] the Netherlands,[33] Slovenia and the United Kingdom,[34] whilst topping the charts in Hungary,[35] Norway[36] and Sweden.[37]</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>1975</b> - In 1975 Jobs joined a group known as the Homebrew Computer Club. One member, a technical whiz named Steve Wozniak, was trying to build a computer. Jobs and Wozniak attended meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club in 1975, which was a stepping stone to the development and marketing of the first Apple computer.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>2013–2014: True</b> - In March 2013, Bergling announced and premiered new tracks from his forthcoming new album True—which was released in September that year—during his Main Stage set at Ultra Music Festival in Miami. The new tracks were experimental in nature. For example, Bergling brought out a stomping band to play through the new bluegrass-tinged song "Wake Me Up".[55] Many of these new songs received mixed critical reviews after the concert.[56]

On 11 April 2013, Bergling released his new album promo mix on SoundCloud. It contained some songs from True and some of his non-album singles.[57] It also contained some of his IDs such as "Black and Blue" and "Enough is Enough (Don't Give Up On Us)".

The EBU and SVT announced on 15 April that Bergling, along with ex-ABBA members Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson, had composed the anthem for the Eurovision Song Contest 2013. The song was performed for the first time in the Final on 18 May.[5</li>

				PDT) on October 5, 2011, due to complications from a relapse of his previously treated islet-cell pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor,which resulted in respiratory arrest. He had lost consciousness the day before and died with his wife, children, and sisters at his side. His sister, Mona Simpson, described his death thus: "Steve's final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times. Before embarking, he'd looked at his sister Patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life's partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them. Steve's final words were: 'Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.'" He then lost consciousness and died several hours later. A small private funeral was held on October 7, 2011, the details of which, out of respect for Jobs's family, were not made public.</li>
